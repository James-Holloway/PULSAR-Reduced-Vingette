# PULSAR-Reduced-Vingette
A mod for PULSAR: Lost Colony that reduces the annoying heal/damage vignette to a minimum while still existing. I created this because the vignette was too annoying and bright.

### Extra info

Made for Beta 29.6 but should last longer than just this version. Make sure you have the latest PULSAR Plugin Loader too.

If you want to build this yourself, you will very likely need to adjust the references. If not, check Releases to download the latest version.

This project may also serve as a simple reference for a starter Harmony/PULSAR mod.
